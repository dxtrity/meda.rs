# Rust-based Blockchain
**Meda.rs** is a **[Rust](https://rust-lang.org)** implementation of **[Andromeda](https://github.com/dxtrity/andromeda)**.

Which is a blockchain written using the **[Go](https://go.dev) Programming Language**.

## Warning this is **NOT** a finished project. Or a working, battle-tested and good one either. This is one of my first projects with Rust so there is bound to be errors.

## Building
Clone the Repo:

``git clone github.com/dxtrity/meda.rs``

Build it with:

``cargo build``

## Why is this a thing?
Short answer: Testing.

Long Answer, I want to try out different programming languages and see which one is easier to build blockchain applications with. I've experimented with Python, Go and even JavaScript. I made a lot of progress with **Andromeda** using Go and am likely to continue it using it to develop Andromeda. However, I had heard a lot of good things about **Rust** and wanted to give it a try. Overall, my experience with **Rust** is mixed so far. I had found that the **cargo** package manager was a lot easier to use than **Go**'s ``go get`` function but at the end it made a very large application after it's painfully long build time. Although, It's syntax and general programming experience feels much better than **Go**.

## Will this continue being developed?
Maybe. If I end up getting fed up with **Go** I will come back to this project and continue development on it. But for now, It's going to live in this repository until I either forget about it or come back crying.

## Am I allowed to use the source code?
Go for it! If you feel feel like you want to continue this you can make a **Pull Request** or **Fork** it. It's licensed under **MIT**.
